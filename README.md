 My test Unity project
 
 This is my first serious Unity project, where i try out most of basic technics used in game development. I was inspired by World of Tanks, and decided to recreate its look and gameplay.
 
 Assets used:
 
 Global Roads & Traffic [Lite] - to generate world map from real maps
 
 Stylized Rocket Launcher Complete Kit - shooter for turret
